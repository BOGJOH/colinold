            <h3>Why Me</h3>

            <p>
              One of the joys of teaching is sharing in the success of past students who have done really well in their higher education studies. Over the years, I have checked a large number of
              students’ essays and dissertations, at both undergraduate and post-graduate levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having studied grammar and syntax in my own degree courses, I am knowledgeable about numerous grammatical constructions and the conventions which govern them. Even when dealing with
              highly-specialised terminology, I am able to make information flow in a cogent way. I am therefore keen to put my secure understanding of grammar to good use!
