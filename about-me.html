        <p>
          My name is Colin Paul Old and I’m from Gosport, a town within the Greater Portsmouth area, a city on the South coast of England. I attended Bay House Secondary School and 6th- Form College,
          after which I became an undergraduate at London University’s ‘Institute of Education.’ Having completed a BA Honours Degree in English and a Post Graduate Certificate in Education, I taught
          English full-time for 35 years before semi-retiring in the summer of 2020. Whilst teaching, I also completed a Masters degree in Education at Southampton University.
        </p>
        <p>I have lived in Hampshire most of my life where I enjoy singing with local choirs, gardening, reading and watching movies.</p>

          <h3>Travel</h3>
          <main>
            <p>
              From the time I visited Paris in the late 1970s, I caught the ‘Travel Bug.’ Even though I have visited this city many times, I never tire of it, especially as there is usually a photo
              opportunity to be had on every street corner. I’m an avid traveller and enjoy taking photographs in interesting locations. I find Eastern Europe fascinating especially those countries
              such as Serbia and Moldova which are still relatively off the tourist trail. I have made friends in these places and love sharing cultures and traditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The country of Romania and its culture has been a love of mine for the past 12 years, over which time I have encountered a wealth of experiences. Since visiting the country in 2009, I
              have returned on numerous occasions – each one different and enlightening.

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <main>
            <p>
              Having learnt the piano from the age of 9 and contributed to various school orchestras and choirs over the years, my love of music is what motivates me in life! Popular Music is of
              interest to me, especially music of the 60s and 70s, but my overwhelming passion is for Classical Music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being able to read music, and having studied the subject for O-level and A-level, this has given me the confidence to write my own pieces. Choral Music is my preferred medium and I have
              written anthems and carols which have been sung by cathedrals and choral ensembles in Britain and around the world. I sing in a number of local choirs: ‘Portsmouth Choral Union,’ ‘The
              Chichester Singers’ and ‘Chichester Cathedral Voluntary Choir.’ I also take part in worship in a couple of local churches. Attending orchestral concerts in Britain and abroad is
              something I particularly enjoy.

            <p>
              I was recently given the opportunity of hosting a new radio show for a new local radio station, ‘Outreach Radio.’ This is a totally new venture for me but one which I seem to have taken
              to like a duck to water, as they say. In hosting a show, I need to combine my knowledge of Classical Music with my teaching experience. As a teacher, one needs to be a proficient orator
              and verbal communicator as well as a subject specialist, so these skills I have been able to utilise effectively.
